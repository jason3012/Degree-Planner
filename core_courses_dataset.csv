Significantly, we ""de-construct"" common notions of Black Women's Writing by examining the varied genres these writers use to express their imaginings. Required readings come from the fields of science fiction (Octavia Butler), prose/experimental (Gayl Jones and M artha Southgate) novels, drama (Suzan-Lori Parks), poetry (Elizabeth Alexander), and autobiography/memoir (Toi Derricotte).",3,Stokes Hall 113S TuTh 12:00 Noon-01:15PM,Cultural Diversity,None,None,AADS2201,Undergraduate

We will concentrate on approaches, methods, and themes of interest as we assemble critical skills for making interpretive arguments about aspects of culture in their historical moment. While assembling a toolkit of interpretive moves we can make on American culture and working to build stronger analyses, we will also consider how American society and culture have been defined by differences of race, class, gender, sexuality, dis/ability, religion, and other socio-cultural categories. We will consider how American Studies scholars have combined theory and praxis in order to expose injustice in the nations past and present; form communities based on principles of inclusion and solidarity; and create just conditions for citizenship and humanity. The materials we analyze will include examples from film, television, music, literature, theater, comics, photography, advertising, among others. Each unit will be organized around a question that generates further questions, analysis, and discussion. The questions include, for instance, Why is Indigenous Studies central to American Studies?, What does visual culture tell us about race in modern America?, and How do we see race and religion after ? During the semester, we will also attend a number of events sponsored by American Studies, AADS, and other interdisciplinary departments, centers, and programs that represent a variety of interests, subjects, and approaches.

In particular, this course will study how writers/artists such as Art Spiegelman, M arjane Satrapi, Alison Bechdel, Gene Lueng Yang, Thi Bui, and Joe Sacco, among others, use the medium of comics to engage readers in exploring and analyzing issues of difference and justice. How do graphic artists represent issues of race and ethnicity, especially among minority communities that struggle against a long history of racist representation in the US media? How do graphic artists depict issues related to gender, sexual orientation, social class, religion, etc. This course will highlight how artists use graphic narratives to call attention to cases of humanitarian crises in the US and in different parts of the world. The medium of comics, considered marginal, lends itself to advocacy of issues of marginalized groups in society. The medium also creates space for encouraging artists as well as audiences to think otherwise, to imagine alternative social possibilities.

But it is equally true that learning extends well beyond the years and settings of formal education. From birth on, humans are learning through experience in the context of families, communities, and a wide range of practices and institutions. We will read and discuss texts to consider how human across the world differently experience and structure these two kinds of learning. We will, for instance, explore how schools from M ichigan to M anila to M unich are infused not just with explicit pedagogy, but the values of the people that populate them.
